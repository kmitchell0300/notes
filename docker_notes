# command - docker container top  <name> ( gives you the processes of the container)

# command - docker container rm -f <name> <name> <name> (rm will REMOVE -f will force)

! when you say "docker container run" is looks locally for name you specify if cant find it looks at docker repo

 if not specified it doesn't open

 # command - docker top mongo (show running process have to specify name) 
 # command - docker ps (see docker dockers)
