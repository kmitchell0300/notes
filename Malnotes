malware

process for dynamic  

1)trid.exe
2)detect it easy
3)strings.exe
4) hxd.exe - hexeditor - can search for words 
5) virus total - detection signatures, names, realtiosn, behvaior 

tools:
1)trid.exe - 
2)detect it easy -
3)strings.exe - find strings
4) 7zip - sfx files/archives  
5) renamer - allows to rename mulitple files 
6) sysint - process mon TBD


 wrapper - has everything to run yoru malware will work regarldess of what user installed ( script > vm > unpacker ) 
* how to get code from wrapped file --> dynamically (extract in hex editor, if not encrpyted) can use strings.exe - identify wrapper with (idetify easy and serach for extraction tool) 
* they put embedded files in %temp fodler 
* pws - stankd for password in virus totalt 


create snap shot
disable network 
start process monitor from sys internals as admin
	drop down > category is write.. add
	drop down > process name begins with > wrapped > add
	drop down > proces sname is cmd.exe > add ( becuase of batch file) 
rename file.exe 
dlete / clear event 
turn off capture after running. 

---grabbing files that get deleted---
1) deny folder deletion permissions
- (this does not always work) the file is being deleted or is no longer there in %temp > will deny deletion writes to the folder 
-  > righ tclik on temp > advance > seucirty > system > select users "everyone" > delete subfolders and files and dlete .. apply 

2) break points and api monitor (portable > version of latest )
- need to know what to capture
- find > writefiles > find next > put a checkmark on that and EX version (extended)
- finde createprocessA & createprocessW (check mark those) 
- run file (wrapped1.exe) 
- find the process creation point > right click break poin > before call (has to write everythign before executing) 

3)
strings
- use and find encrypting version software

15.0 - 7zip had decompiler only verion for nsi.. NSIS..	 - sourceforge - 1505-x64.exe - file manger - will unpack  

7zip can execure within a packed file 
sfx files try 7zip 

renaming tool:
"renamer" if you need to rename a ton of files - portable version . den4b.com 

 triaging multiple files 
- see in stirngs.exe if other fiels are refrenced 
- power shell scrip to run trid on all files..
- look to see if there is a command line version to to pipe all files to it

ASEPs -  auto start extensibility points (runs automatically without user interaction) 
1. system persistence - windows - autorun ( run,runonce,runoncexe, startup folder, scheduled tasks (xml in sys32), SCM
2. program loader abuse - ifeo(image files) , extension hijacking , shortcut manipulation, shim db, com hijacking 
3. applicatoin abuse - plugin extensions - ( trojan system binary, office add-ins, browser helper objects (BHO)
4. system behavior - winLogOn - file manger sessions(explorer.exe), userinit.exe, DLL, appinit(secureboot), 

**asep tools (sysinternals autoruns), winesap forensics(memory), farbar recovery scan tool


windows registry 
* place for malware to persist, autorun etc, filess malware lives in registry  
* reg_sz - fixed lenght string - file  names
* reg_dword - true or false 1 or 0 
* reg_binary - 


*create snapshow
- upper left > machine > take snapshot 
- name (clean snapshot)

*resize machine
- top bar > device > insert guest additins cd image 
- docudments > this pc > cd drive > virtual box guest edditin > click on vboxwindowsadditions-amd64
- clieck yes - next - install - finish - reboot now 
- log in (now you can resize ) 

*see hidden files and folders
- file explorer
- view > optins > view > show hidden files,folders&drives
- remove > any checkmark under "hide" 
- displays warning > selet yes
- if working you should see desktop.ini on your desktop

*disable win defender
- search in browser > defender remover ionuttbara 
 github.com/ionuttbara/windwos-defender-remover/release
- releases > go to version 12.4 > assets > defenderRemover.exe
- highlight mouse over download > select three button > keep > show more > keep anyway
- tells you malicious > click more info > run anyway > yes
- select Y in cmdline > hit enter
- the machine will reboot
WINDOW DEFENDER IS NOW REMOVED
- test > go to www.eicar.org > download anti malware testfile > righclick > save as link > eicar.com file 

* how to get malware
- since we have internet > downlaod directly > github from udemypage - https://github.com/struppigel/HedgehogLab > download zip > archvies files 

* transfering malware 
- always encrypt malware with the password "infected" -industry standard 
- (transfwering between main and guest host)
    - power off machine first > shared files (power off state)
    - settings on virtualbox > shared folders > selected + and select a folder on you machine > name it > readonly > check [] read only & [] auto-mount > click ok 
- sometimes you might need to trasnfer logs but no read only 
- name > writable > no check marks > no mount and click ok  
- writable is not visbile you need to create a batch file >
 * open notepad on vitual host > "net use h: \\vboxsrv\Writeable_shared > save as batch file > mount_sharedfolder.bat > select all files in dropdown ** importat the name of the extenstio SHOULDNT BE the same name of the folder** make writable for host name and mountable_shared for name in virtuablbox foldername

 * create second file to remove moutn 
 - open notepad > "net use H: /delete > file save .bat> unmount_sharedfolder.bat > select all files in downdown on save 

* securre folder created on windows
- shared folder on host machine chcaning (WRITEABLE FODLER )
- deny execution > right click folder > properties > security > edit > add > eveyone > okay > click on everyone > advance > everyone > edit > show advance permission > dropdown type: deny > drop down under applies to: this fodler,subfolder  & files > uncheck everything but (traveser folder/execute files) > click ok and ok > warning > click continue  > 
* teste by puting calc.exe in folder and trying to open it > add new folder in folder and copy calc.exe and try to open it 

* opening malware
- rename file with ".vir" extension > it makes it so it cant load 


* network settings 
- virtuabl box > setttings > network > attached to > not attached 


1st malware
* machine > take snapshot (EVERY TIME BEFORE RUNNING)
exmaple name : first sample execution 
* rename with .exe extenstion > getting rid of .vir 
* double click to run. needs .net framework 3.5 should see
* install .net framework
* disable internet
* snapshot with .net 

reboot from snapshot
* file close > power off machine > restore current snapshot
* 2nd option > virtual box > 3 dots > snapshot > make sure to uncheck (create a snapshot of the current smachine state)
click start > you should see restoring machine 


disable windows updates
- group policy editor 
- windows key > type group policy > select edit gorupu policy >  commputer config > admin templates > windows components > windows update > specify intranet microsoft updates service location > select enabled > set intranet url > type anything that doesn exist > https://ajdflk;sfjlsd;jf.com > click ok 


triage
* file type - (TrID, hex editor,)
* whole file examination ( strings, visualization, hex editor)
* metadata view ( file format viewer, headers)
* automatic reports (sandbox reports, autoamtic analysis, antivirus scan results)
* first reseach (avail on internet , comments of others)


downloads
* [x] sysinternals 
* [x] notepad++
* [x] HxD - mh-nexus.de
* [x] TrID - mark0.net/soft-trid-e.html - win 32 and download trIDDef.trd package  
* [x] Detect it Easy - github.com/horsicq/detect-it-easy
* [x] Ink_parser - code.google.com/archive/p/lnk-parser/downloads#

saved websites
* [x] malpedia
* [x] VirusTOtal
* [x] MS-SHLLINNK format 

USING TRID  (tells you what kind of file it is)
*has large database of file extensions, update regulary might need to pull down list frequently
* open command line 
* go desktop > type: trid.exe
* trid.exe filename
example output - .LNK, unknown, exe 

USING detectITEasy(tells you file types and more)
run die.exe > drag and drop file into it

using strings.exe (sysinternals) use 4 for small files in kb and 6 for largerfiles (must be in the directory of sysinternals where folder is located)
*open powershell
*run .\sysinternalsSuite\strings.exe -n 4 .\filename

using LNK parser ( )
* in powershell in lnkparser directory type the following:
* .\lnk_parser_cmd.exe .\filename
* can create an html report with -w (.\lnk_parser_cmd.exe -w .\filename)
* look at (lnk target id list) this shows you what is happeneidng , windows, system32, cmd.exe
* look at string data - if you see /c with cmdds this is the what command is run
* to see the icon you can change file name to .lnk ( before you do this make sure in vm and have restore point it can execute by file name change way windows treats the fiel )


using hxd (hex editor)
* just open .exe and drag and drop file

antivirus detection names: all different for companies 
example: trojan:win32/gandcrab.af.dam - (type,platform,family,variant,modifier)

platform - 32bit,powershell,.net,linux
type - trojan(default type for unknown), rat,
familiy - agent(default name,means nothing, generic), gen i.e generic,heur i.e heuristic which detectino componont saud its malware or malawre family 
variant  - sinature counter or id (for anti virus company)
modifer - optional
* krypt - packed, MS - microsoft - ai is artificiual intelegence, inject = packed , antixy (goes after antivirus mechnism delete entries) , antivm - does not run in vm, xyfake - imitate adobe or ms file, (razy,kazy,zusy,graftor,)- is all tools/vendor finding it

AUTOSCANNIG
* virutotal - detection names
* from the information spit out on virus total and malware families you might see names you dont recongnize.. use malpedia to look them out. example: houdini .. .then it will tell you more about the malware and you can tell if your anlaysis is the same and malware already found 


cmd prompt - notes: "&" seperates new lines. you can replace them with new lines.  

wrapper - has everythign to run your malware wil work redhardless of what user installed (script>vm>unpckar) 
howto get coe from wrapped file > dynamiccaly (extract in hex editor, if not encrpyted) can use stings.exe - identify wrapper with (identify easy and seacrh for extraction tool)

ORDER PROCESS ON SAMPLE:
* trid - see what the fiel format is 
* virus total sample (look at behvior and file drop )
* strings 
*  sysinternals - look at strings ( )
* lnk parser (arguemtns to see taks )
* break appart any arguments to see what its doing.. manual if CMD commands or powershell etc. (identify line breaks ; or & etc )
    use get-help command in powershell - update-help (get-help -name NAME)
*
